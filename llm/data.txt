Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for INTEL
1. Provisioning Patterns
Users and Instances:
Jeevan: Created 5 instances (vm_87, vm_88, vm_95, vm_98, vm_103).
Kishan: Created 10 instances (vm_86, vm_89, vm_90, vm_91, vm_92, vm_94, vm_96, vm_97, vm_99, vm_104).
Sharath: Created 5 instances (vm_85, vm_93, vm_100, vm_101, vm_102).
Timing:
Most provisioning occurs during business hours (e.g., 09:00–18:00 UTC), but some instances are created late at night (e.g., vm_87 at 00:21, vm_104 at 00:47).
Anomaly: vm_95 was provisioned at 23:05, which is unusual unless it’s for a scheduled task.
2. Job Execution Patterns
CPU Utilization:
Most instances average 30–70% CPU usage, with peaks at 68.8% (vm_96 by Kishan) and lows at 30.2% (vm_97 by Kishan).
Inefficiency: Several instances run at low CPU (<40%) for extended periods (e.g., vm_97 at 30.2%, vm_103 at 33.8%), suggesting over-provisioning.
Duration:
Some jobs run for very long durations (e.g., vm_98 ran for 15 hours on 2025-04-18, vm_104 for 18 hours on 2025-06-01).
Others are very short-lived (e.g., vm_88 ran for 1 hour on 2025-06-28), which may indicate inefficient resource allocation.
Night-Time Activity:
Several jobs run overnight (e.g., vm_98 from 21:24 to 11:24, vm_95 from 05:24 to 16:24).
This could be batch processing or automated tasks, but if not necessary, it may indicate cost inefficiency.
3. Anomalies & Potential Issues
Overlapping Runs:
On 2025-05-11, vm_98 (Jeevan) and vm_104 (Kishan) both ran overlapping long jobs (~12 hours each), possibly indicating contention.
Underutilized Instances:
vm_92 (Debian) had a run with 32.4% CPU for 16 hours (2025-05-24), suggesting it could be downsized.
vm_97 (Ubuntu) had multiple low-CPU runs (~30–40%), indicating inefficiency.
High CPU Spikes:
vm_102 (Sharath) hit 68% CPU (2025-05-17), which is high for an f1-micro instance. Could benefit from a higher-tier plan if frequent.
4. Usage Gaps
Inactive Instances:
Some instances have long gaps between runs (e.g., vm_85 was unused from 2025-06-05 to 2025-06-14).
Others are rarely used (e.g., vm_93 by Sharath had only 8 runs in 3 months).
Potential Zombie Instances:
vm_101 (Sharath) was provisioned early (2025-04-23) but had only 5 runs in 3 months—may be unused.
5. Recommendations
Right-Sizing:
Consider upgrading instances with consistent high CPU (e.g., vm_102).
Downgrade or terminate underutilized instances (e.g., vm_92, vm_97).
Scheduling Optimization:
Consolidate overnight jobs to reduce idle time.
Use auto-scaling for bursty workloads.
Cost Savings:
Stop/Start instances with long idle periods (e.g., vm_85, vm_101).
Audit rarely used instances for termination.
Monitoring:
Set alerts for CPU spikes (>70%) or prolonged low usage (<30%).
Summary
Efficiency Issues: Low CPU utilization, long idle periods, and sporadic usage suggest resource waste.
Anomalies: Late-night provisioning, overlapping jobs, and inconsistent instance usage.
Action Items: Right-size instances, optimize scheduling, and enforce cleanup of unused resources.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for NVIDIA
Overview
The logs show provisioning and runtime activity for NVIDIA's cloud instances across three users: BL Yashvanth, Kiran, and Sanketh. The data reveals patterns in instance usage, potential inefficiencies, and anomalies.
Key Findings
Provisioning Patterns
Instance Types:
Most instances are either f1-micro (smaller, cheaper) or n1-standard-4 (larger, more expensive)
Ubuntu (15 instances), Debian (16), and CentOS (11) are the primary OS distributions
Provisioning Times:
Frequent provisioning occurs between 02:00-05:00 UTC (nighttime activity)
BL Yashvanth tends to provision larger instances (n1-standard-4), while Kiran and Sanketh provision more f1-micro instances
Runtime Patterns & Anomalies
High CPU Utilization:
Many instances show consistently high CPU usage (70-97%), suggesting they may be under-provisioned
Notable high-usage instances:
vm_63 (CentOS, f1-micro) hit 97.9% CPU
vm_81 (Debian, f1-micro) hit 95.1% CPU
vm_73 (CentOS, n1-standard-4) hit 97.8% CPU
Nighttime Activity:
Significant job execution occurs overnight (00:00-06:00 UTC), suggesting batch processing or automated workloads
Example: vm_65 ran from 00:24 to 14:24 on 2025-04-24 with 93.9% CPU
Potential Inefficiencies:
Several f1-micro instances show sustained high CPU usage, indicating they may need larger instance types
Some instances have long runtimes with high CPU but short gaps between runs, suggesting they could be left running continuously
Usage Gaps:
Many instances show sporadic usage patterns with significant gaps between runs
Example: vm_76 was provisioned on 2025-06-23 but only shows one run on 2025-06-28
User-Specific Observations
BL Yashvanth:
Focuses on larger instances (n1-standard-4)
Shows consistent usage patterns, likely for production workloads
vm_79 is particularly active with multiple long-running jobs
Kiran:
Provisions many f1-micro instances
Shows more experimental usage patterns with frequent provisioning and deprovisioning
Several instances (vm_57, vm_64) have high CPU usage on small instances
Sanketh:
Mix of instance types
Shows some extremely high CPU usage on f1-micro instances that likely need upgrading
vm_63 consistently shows dangerously high CPU usage (97.9% peak)
Recommendations
Resource Optimization:
Upgrade consistently high-usage f1-micro instances (especially vm_63, vm_81) to larger instance types
Consider reserved instances for frequently used resources to reduce costs
Operational Improvements:
Implement auto-scaling for workloads with predictable patterns
Schedule non-critical jobs to run during off-peak hours
Monitor and potentially consolidate underutilized instances
Cost Savings Opportunities:
Review instances with large gaps between usage for potential decommissioning
Consider spot instances for batch processing workloads that can tolerate interruptions
Performance Monitoring:
Set up alerts for sustained high CPU usage (>90%) to prevent performance degradation
Implement logging for failed jobs (none shown in current logs)
The data suggests NVIDIA could optimize costs and performance by right-sizing instances and implementing more systematic workload scheduling.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Texas Instruments
1. Provisioning Patterns
Timing of Provisioning:
Most provisioning actions occur in the early morning (UTC), e.g., between 04:00 and 08:00.
Example: instancegcp12 (04:35), instancegcp6 (04:55), instancegcp7 (07:38).
Syed Umair provisions instances more sporadically, including late-night or midday (e.g., debian11-api-final1 at 14:24).
Instance Types:
Predominantly f1-micro (low-cost, low-resource) and g1-small/n1-standard-4 (higher-resource).
Potential Issue: High-CPU usage (see below) on f1-micro instances suggests under-provisioning. For example:
instancegcp7 (Ubuntu, f1-micro) averages 78.6% CPU during runs.
instancegcp11 (Ubuntu, n1-standard-4) peaks at 91.3% CPU, indicating heavy workloads.
2. CPU Usage Anomalies
High CPU Utilization:
Several instances consistently run at >75% CPU (risk of performance degradation):
instancegcp6 (Ubuntu, f1-micro): Peaks at 91.3% CPU (2025-06-10).
instancegcp11 (Ubuntu, n1-standard-4): 87.4% CPU (2025-05-30).
debian11-api-final0 (Debian, f1-micro): 90.8% CPU (2025-06-23).
Recommendation: Upgrade f1-micro instances to larger plans (e.g., g1-small) or optimize workloads.
Low Utilization:
Some instances have gaps or low CPU usage (e.g., instancegcp2 runs at 55.9% CPU intermittently). Could indicate over-provisioning.
3. Night-Time Activity
Unusual Activity:
Jack and Mike have frequent late-night runs (e.g., 23:00–05:00 UTC):
instancegcp7 runs from 2025-05-15T23:24 to 2025-05-16T04:24 (79.7% CPU).
instnacegcp8 runs from 2025-05-26T22:24 to 2025-05-27T05:24 (78.2% CPU).
Potential Issue: Could be automated jobs, but if not expected, may indicate unauthorized usage.
4. Failed Jobs or Errors
No explicit failures in logs, but:
High CPU spikes (>90%) may lead to timeouts or crashes.
Instance Deletion: ansible instance was deleted on 2025-07-01 (possibly intentional).
5. Efficiency Gaps
Underutilized Instances:
instancegcp6 (Ubuntu, f1-micro) is provisioned on 2025-04-17 but only used heavily starting 2025-05-29 (17-day gap).
instancegcp10 (Debian, f1-micro) is provisioned on 2025-04-19 but first used on 2025-05-08 (19-day gap).
Recommendation: Audit unused instances for cost savings.
Overlapping Runs:
On 2025-06-25, instancegcp12 and instancegcp7 run simultaneously (CPU 65.8% and 84.4%). Could consolidate workloads.
6. User-Specific Observations
Syed Umair:
Manages the most instances (instancegcp1 to instancegcp5, ansible, debian11-api-final*).
High Churn: Creates and deletes ansible instances frequently (may indicate testing).
Mike:
Focuses on f1-micro instances (instnacegcp8, instancegcp9, instancegcp10).
Consistent Usage: No long gaps, but CPU is often high (e.g., instnacegcp8 at 82.7%).
Recommendations
Upgrade Overloaded Instances: Move f1-micro instances with >70% CPU to g1-small or n1-standard-*.
Audit Night-Time Activity: Verify if late-night runs are legitimate (e.g., backups, batch jobs).
Clean Up Unused Instances: Terminate idle instances (e.g., instancegcp6, instancegcp10).
Monitor CPU Trends: Set alerts for CPU >80% to prevent performance issues.
Optimize Scheduling: Avoid overlapping high-CPU jobs on the same instance.
Summary Table of Key Issues
Issue	Example Instance	Recommendation
High CPU (>90%)	debian11-api-final0	Upgrade instance plan
Night-time activity	instancegcp7 (23:00–04:00)	Verify automation legitimacy
Long idle periods	instancegcp10 (19 days)	Terminate if unused
Overlapping workloads	instancegcp12 + gcp7	Consolidate or reschedule


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Western Digital
1. Instance Provisioning & Deletion Patterns
Initial Provisioning (April 19, 2025):
Three instances (instancegcp1, instancegcp2, instancegcp3) were created within a short span (~7 minutes).
instancegcp1 (f1-micro) is a low-resource instance, while instancegcp2 and instancegcp3 (n1-standard-4) are higher-resource instances.
Observation: Possible testing or deployment of a multi-tier application (e.g., frontend on f1-micro, backend on n1-standard-4).
July 3, 2025:
Spike in Activity: Multiple instances (instancegcp4, instancegcp6, instancegcp7) were created and deleted rapidly (~1-hour window).
Quota Exceeded: On July 11, a provisioning attempt failed due to exceeding the instance limit (Limit: 5.0).
Anomaly: Short-lived instances suggest testing or misconfigured auto-scaling.
2. Failed Workflows (July 4, 2025)
High Failure Rate:
12 out of 13 workflow executions failed on July 4, with durations ranging from 434s to 187,542s (~52 hours).
One long-running failure (187,542s) suggests a stuck process or resource exhaustion.
Possible Causes:
Configuration errors (e.g., incorrect job parameters).
Resource contention (CPU/memory limits exceeded).
Dependency failures (e.g., external API unavailability).
3. Night-Time & High-CPU Activity
Instances with High CPU Usage:
instancegcp4 (f1-micro) consistently hits 70-84% CPU (e.g., May 20-22, June 18, July 4).
instancegcp3 (n1-standard-4) peaks at 84% CPU (June 26).
Inefficiency: f1-micro instances are underpowered for sustained high CPU loads. Upgrading to n1-standard-* could prevent throttling.
Night-Time Activity:
instancegcp6 (CentOS): Runs overnight (e.g., May 9-10, May 14-15).
instancegcp1 (Ubuntu): Active late at night (e.g., May 1-2, June 1-2).
Potential Use Case: Batch processing, backups, or automated tasks.
4. Instance Utilization Insights
Underutilized Instances:
instancegcp2 (n1-standard-4) often runs at ~40-50% CPU, suggesting over-provisioning.
instancegcp7 (f1-micro) has sporadic usage (e.g., runs for 3-6 hours with moderate CPU).
Overloaded Instances:
instancegcp4 (f1-micro) frequently hits >75% CPU, risking performance degradation.
5. Backup & Administrative Actions
Backup Activity (July 2, 2025):
instancegcp7-clone was created by "Syed Admin," likely for disaster recovery.
No further backups logged—consider scheduling regular backups.
6. Recommendations
Optimize Instance Sizing:
Upgrade instancegcp4 from f1-micro to n1-standard-1 to handle high CPU loads.
Downsize instancegcp2 if consistent low usage persists.
Investigate Workflow Failures:
Audit logs for July 4 to identify root cause (e.g., timeout settings, resource limits).
Implement retry logic for transient failures.
Quota Management:
Monitor instance count to avoid quota limits (e.g., auto-delete unused instances).
Night-Time Automation:
Schedule resource-intensive jobs during off-peak hours to reduce daytime contention.
Backup Strategy:
Ensure regular backups for critical instances (e.g., instancegcp3).
Summary of Anomalies
Issue	Example	Severity
Quota exceeded	July 11 failure (INSTANCES limit)	High
Frequent instance churn	July 3 rapid create/delete	Medium
High CPU on f1-micro	instancegcp4 at 84% CPU	High
Workflow failures	12/13 failed on July 4	Critical
Action Items:
Adjust instance types based on workload.
Debug workflow failures.
Set up alerts for quota limits.

Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for NVIDIA
1. Provisioning Patterns
BL Yashvanth:

Provisioned 6 instances (vm_65, vm_73, vm_79, vm_61, vm_67, vm_69) between April and June 2025.
Mostly uses n1-standard-4 plans (higher CPU/memory) except for vm_67 and vm_69 (f1-micro).
Night-time provisioning observed: vm_65 at 04:50 UTC, vm_79 at 03:43 UTC.
Kiran:

Provisioned 15 instances, mostly f1-micro plans (low-cost), with a few n1-standard-4 (vm_56, vm_76, vm_75, vm_78).
Frequent provisioning in early morning hours (e.g., vm_57 at 04:52 UTC, vm_58 at 06:04 UTC).
Sanketh:

Provisioned 7 instances, mostly f1-micro except vm_80 (n1-standard-4).
Some late-night provisioning: vm_63 at 23:39 UTC.
2. Job Execution Patterns (Run Activities)
High CPU Utilization:

Many jobs run at high CPU (70-97% avg), indicating efficient resource use but potential overloading, especially for f1-micro instances.
Examples:
vm_63 (Sanketh): 97.9% CPU (April 26).
vm_81 (Kiran): 95.1% CPU (April 11).
vm_73 (BL Yashvanth): 97.8% CPU (April 16).
Long-Running Jobs:

Some jobs run for 12+ hours, e.g., vm_65 (BL Yashvanth) ran for 14 hours on April 24.
vm_79 (BL Yashvanth) frequently runs long jobs (e.g., 17 hours on June 25).
Night-Time Activity:

Many jobs run overnight (e.g., vm_69 from 20:24 to 06:24 UTC on April 15-16).
Possible automated batch jobs or unattended processes.
3. Anomalies and Inefficiencies
Overloaded f1-micro Instances:

f1-micro instances (low-resource) frequently hit high CPU (e.g., vm_69 at 97.8%, vm_81 at 95.1%). This suggests under-provisioning; upgrading to n1-standard-4 might be needed.
Underutilized Instances:

Some n1-standard-4 instances have lower CPU (e.g., vm_65 at 71.4% on May 25). Could be downsized to f1-micro if usage is consistently low.
Short, Frequent Jobs:

Some jobs run for <1 hour (e.g., vm_83 at 81.2% for 1 hour). Could be optimized for cost by using preemptible instances or serverless functions.
Gaps in Usage:

Some instances show sporadic activity (e.g., vm_76 provisioned on June 23 but only has 2 runs). May indicate idle resources.
4. User-Specific Observations
BL Yashvanth:
Heavy usage of vm_79 (Ubuntu, n1-standard-4) with frequent long jobs. Possibly a critical workload.
Kiran:
Many f1-micro instances with high CPU. Potential cost savings by consolidating workloads.
Sanketh:
vm_82 (CentOS, f1-micro) frequently runs high-CPU jobs. May need upgrade.
5. Recommendations
Right-Sizing:
Upgrade overloaded f1-micro instances (e.g., vm_69, vm_81) to n1-standard-4.
Downsize underutilized n1-standard-4 instances (e.g., vm_65 if low usage persists).
Scheduling:
Investigate night-time jobs for automation opportunities (e.g., batch scheduling).
Cost Optimization:
Use preemptible instances for short-lived, non-critical jobs.
Delete or stop idle instances (e.g., vm_76 with minimal runs).
Monitoring:
Set up alerts for sustained high CPU (>90%) to prevent performance issues.
Summary
The logs show efficient resource usage but with some inefficiencies (overloaded small instances, idle resources). Optimizing instance sizes and scheduling could reduce costs and improve performance. Night-time activity suggests automated processes, which may need further tuning.



Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Texas Instruments
1. Instance Provisioning Patterns
High Frequency of f1-micro Instances:

Most instances are provisioned with the f1-micro plan (low-cost, low-resource), suggesting lightweight workloads or potential underutilization.
A few instances use g1-small or n1-standard-4, indicating sporadic higher-resource needs (e.g., instancegcp11 and ansible).
Provisioning Time:

Most provisioning occurs in the early morning (UTC) or late night (e.g., 04:00–05:00 UTC), likely automated or non-business-hour activity.
Anomaly: User "Syed Umair" provisioned multiple instances (debian11-api-final0, debian11-api-final1, debian11-api-final2) in quick succession on 2025-06-09, suggesting a batch deployment.
2. Job Execution Patterns
CPU Utilization:

f1-micro instances often hit high CPU averages (70–90%) during runs, indicating potential overutilization for their plan (e.g., instancegcp7, instnacegcp8). This could lead to throttling or performance issues.
n1-standard-4 instances (e.g., instancegcp11) show moderate CPU use (~60–80%), suggesting better resource alignment.
Long-Running Jobs:

Several jobs run for 12+ hours (e.g., instancegcp7 on 2025-04-19 ran for 17 hours). This could indicate inefficient job scheduling or resource-heavy tasks.
Night-Time Activity: Jobs frequently run overnight (e.g., instancegcp6 on 2025-05-29 from 23:24 to 12:24 UTC), likely automated batch processing.
3. Anomalies
Overlapping Runs:

On 2025-05-19, instancegcp2 and debian11-api-final2 had overlapping high-CPU jobs (14:24–22:24 UTC), which might strain shared resources.
instancegcp11 hit 91.3% CPU on 2025-06-10, suggesting a potential spike or inefficient workload.
Orphaned Instances:

instancegcp6 was provisioned on 2025-04-17 but only used twice (on 2025-05-29 and 2025-06-09), indicating underutilization.
ansible instances (provisioned by "Syed Umair") were deleted after minimal use, possibly temporary testing.
4. Inefficiencies
Underutilized Instances:

Many f1-micro instances have sporadic usage (e.g., instancegcp1, instancegcp5), running infrequently but consuming resources.
Recommendation: Consolidate workloads or use auto-scaling for variable demand.
Resource Mismatches:

High-CPU jobs on f1-micro plans (e.g., instancegcp7 at 86.9% CPU) suggest a need for larger instance types.
Recommendation: Upgrade frequently used instances (e.g., instancegcp7) to g1-small or higher.
5. Failed Jobs
No explicit failures in logs, but high CPU usage could imply performance degradation or unlogged errors.
6. Summary of Key Insights
Pattern	Example	Recommendation
Overused f1-micro	instancegcp7 at 86.9% CPU	Upgrade instance plan
Underutilized instances	instancegcp6 used twice in 2 months	Terminate or consolidate
Night-time automation	Jobs at 03:00–05:00 UTC	Verify if intentional (e.g., backups)
High-CPU overlaps	Multiple jobs on 2025-05-19	Stagger schedules or scale resources
Actionable Recommendations
Right-Sizing:
Upgrade frequently used f1-micro instances to g1-small or higher.
Terminate unused instances (e.g., instancegcp6).
Automation Review:
Audit night-time jobs for necessity and efficiency.
Monitoring:
Set alerts for CPU >80% to preempt performance issues.
Cost Optimization:
Use preemptible instances for non-critical batch jobs.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Western Digital
1. Instance Provisioning and Deletion Patterns
Initial Provisioning (April 19, 2025):

Three instances were created in quick succession (instancegcp1, instancegcp2, instancegcp3).
Two of these (instancegcp2, instancegcp3) are n1-standard-4 (higher resource tier), while instancegcp1 is f1-micro (low-cost tier).
Observation: Possible testing or initial deployment phase.
July 3, 2025:

A burst of provisioning and deletion activity:
instancegcp4, instancegcp6, and instancegcp7 were created.
Some instances were deleted (logs show deletion alerts but don't specify which ones).
Quota Exceeded Error (July 11, 2025):
Attempt to create another instance failed due to hitting the 5-instance limit in us-central1.
Inefficiency: The tenant may not be monitoring instance limits, leading to failed provisioning.
Instance Types:

Mostly f1-micro (low-cost) instances, except for instancegcp2 and instancegcp3 (n1-standard-4).
Anomaly: instancegcp6 is CentOS, while others are Ubuntu/Debian. Could indicate a special-purpose instance.
2. Execution Failures (Workflows)
July 4, 2025:

Multiple Failed Workflows:
10+ workflow executions failed within a short timeframe (~1 hour).
Some runs lasted ~30 minutes (187542s ≈ 52 hours? Likely a data error).
Possible Cause: Configuration errors, resource constraints, or dependency failures.
Only 2 Successful Workflows:
Both completed in ~15-30 minutes.
Local Workflows Also Failing:

Suggests issues may not be cloud-specific but related to task logic or environment.
3. Instance Utilization (Run Logs)
High CPU Usage on f1-micro Instances:

instancegcp4 (Debian, f1-micro) frequently hits 70-80% CPU, which is high for a low-tier instance.
Risk: Potential throttling or instability.
instancegcp1 (Ubuntu, f1-micro) also shows 60-80% CPU at times.
Recommendation: Upgrade to a higher-tier plan (e.g., n1-standard-1) for better performance.
Night-Time Activity:

Several instances (instancegcp3, instancegcp6, instancegcp4) show high activity overnight (UTC):
Could indicate batch jobs or automated processes.
Opportunity: Schedule resource-heavy tasks during off-peak hours to optimize costs.
Underutilized n1-standard-4 Instances:

instancegcp2 and instancegcp3 (n1-standard-4) sometimes run at <50% CPU.
Inefficiency: Over-provisioning; consider downsizing if consistent low usage.
4. Backup and Administrative Actions
July 2, 2025 (Syed Admin):
A backup of instancegcp7 was created (instancegcp7-clone).
A group was created (likely for access control).
Observation: Backup strategy seems ad-hoc; no regular backup logs.
5. Anomalies and Risks
Quota Limit Hit:

On July 11, a provisioning failed due to exceeding instance quota.
Recommendation: Monitor usage and request quota increases proactively.
Failed Workflows on July 4:

High failure rate suggests a systemic issue (e.g., misconfiguration, dependency failure).
Recommendation: Investigate logs for root cause (e.g., timeout, resource limits).
Long-Running Failed Workflow:

One workflow ran for 52 hours before failing—likely a bug or stalled process.
6. Summary of Recommendations
Right-Size Instances:

Upgrade f1-micro instances with high CPU usage (e.g., instancegcp4).
Downsize underused n1-standard-4 instances if possible.
Monitor Quotas:

Track instance counts to avoid provisioning failures.
Investigate Workflow Failures:

Check logs for July 4 failures to identify patterns (e.g., timeouts, resource limits).
Implement Scheduled Backups:

Ensure regular backups (only one backup logged).
Optimize Night-Time Workloads:

Leverage off-peak hours for batch jobs to reduce costs.
Review Instance Deletion Policy:

Deletions seem sporadic; implement lifecycle policies for unused instances.
Final Thoughts
The tenant shows bursty usage patterns, with some inefficiencies in resource allocation.
Workflow reliability is a concern (high failure rate on July 4).
Cost optimization opportunities exist (right-sizing instances, scheduling jobs).
